    <h1>So What are the main benefits of Using GitHub?</h1>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>It makes it easier to contribute to your open source projects</strong></li>
            <P>To be honest, nearly every open source project uses GitHub to manage its project. Using GitHub is free if your poject is open source and includes a wiki and issue tracker that makes it easy to include more indepthe documentation and get feedback about your project. If you want to contribute, you just fork a project, make your changes and then send them a pull request using the GitHub web interface.</P></li>
